#Aws Cli Initializer

###Settings
There is a setting called "Path to AWS cli executable".  This should be a full path to the executable on your system.  
Windows is a little weird in that the AWS cli executable can be in one of two places.  
 - If you installed it using pip, then it will be under your AppData folder.
 - If you installed it using the msi installer, then it should be in your program files folder.
###Download
Under each release of this repository, you should find an executable jar.  This is the binary you want to download and run to use the app.
